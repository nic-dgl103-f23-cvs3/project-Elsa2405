Step 2: Write the homepage content and build it

Note: Failure to create many commits and label them appropriately will significantly impact your grade! Make sure that you commit every couple of hours.

Write the content for your home page: 
Write the content in a text editor (MS Word/Google Docs). Refer to your Website Plan and use these wireframes as inspiration for what content to include in each content block. You will need to submit this document at the end of the week.
Get set up
Sign up for the GitHub Student Development Pack. You will need it later on so that you can publish your website, it can take a few days to process and you’ll need it done by next week.
Accept the Github project link (see project folder)
Clone your repo
Build the mobile HTML for the homepage: 
Create your homepage HTML file, external CSS stylesheet and images folder. Link your HTML file to your CSS file.
Structure the homepage’s mobile content using semantic HTML. Tip: Don’t be tempted to add divs and class name attributes as you are writing your HTML. You will add those as needed later when you write your CSS. 
If your homepage includes a table, form or multimedia then you won’t be able to code those until we’ve studied these topics in class. 
Style your homepage for mobile:
Use the wireframes as inspiration for how to layout each block of content. Write the CSS for each block. 
You are coding mobile-first so don’t worry about the layout of the content on a desktop screen. At this point your homepage should look finished on mobile only.
Make sure that your stylesheet is well organized and uses comments to separate the CSS into different areas.
Style your homepage for desktop:
Add a media query for screens 1200px and wider at the bottom of your CSS file (we’re not going to worry about ipads because time is limited). Add any CSS styles needed to adjust the layout on desktop screens.
Check the Website Technical Requirements in the Project Overview to make sure that your project is meeting the CSS requirements.
